## 9. BOARDS

### 9.1 Main Game Board (Double-Sided)

**Side A: Base Game**
- 4 locations: Downtown, Market Row, Workshop (personal), Theater
- Downtown sub-locations: Dahlgaard's Residence (2 dice), Inn (2 dice), Bank (2 dice)

- 5 locations: Downtown, Market Row, Workshop, Theater, Dark Alley
- Dark Alley sub-area with 4 Special Assignment card decks

### 9.2 Location Slot Pyramid

Each location (except Workshop/Theater) has a pyramid of character placement slots:

**4 Players:**
| Row | Slots | AP Modifier |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| 1 (top) | 1 | +1 |
| 2 (mid) | 2 | 0 |
| 3 (bot) | 3 | -1 |
| **Total** | **6** | |

**3 Players:** Remove 1 slot from row 2 or 3 (neutral disc blocks it)
**2 Players:** Remove 2 slots (or use Turn Setup cards in Duel module)

Note: Our codebase currently uses a different pyramid:
```
Row 1: +1 (1 slot)
Row 2:  0 (2 slots)
Row 3: -1 (3 slots)
```

Some sources describe the base game pyramid as:
```
Top:    +2 (1 slot)
Middle: +1 (2 slots)
Bottom:  0 (1 slot)
```

**VERIFICATION NEEDED**: The exact AP modifiers per slot may vary. The rulebook states "first provides +2, next two +1, fourth +0" for some locations. This needs cross-referencing with the physical game.
